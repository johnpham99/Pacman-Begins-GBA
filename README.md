## Setup
To run this project, download "PacmanBegins.gba" and a GBA emulator.

For MAC, <a href="http://openemu.org/">OpenEmu</a> is a good one.

Run the .gba file with the GBA emulator.

If you don't want to go through the trouble, you can just watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dj9m7D6YTw">gameplay video</a> here.

## Status
I am finished with this project.
